# Clue
Implementation of the Clue board game for a university project based upon the board game Cluedo.

The goal of the game is to solve a murder case by finding out the location, the murder weapon and the murder.

Our version of Clue has intrigue tiles which cause special effects to the player landing on the tile.

We also allow players to design the layout of their maps using our map builder.
