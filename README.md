# Clue
Implementation of the Clue board game for a university project based upon the board game Cluedo.

The goal of the game is to solve a murder case by finding out the location, the murder weapon and the murder.

Our version of Clue has intrigue tiles which cause special effects to the player landing on the tile.

We also allow players to design the layout of their maps using our map builder.

#Archers Avenue game board

The game is set on Archers Avenue. 
A murder has taken place and it is up to the players to find out the murderer, murder location and murder weapon.

Players can do this by making suggesting a weapon, person and location. During a suggestion, up to one player refutes the suggestion because they have one of the cards that were listed in the suggestion.
Once a player thinks they know the correct information, they can accuse the murderer, location and weapon.

Accusations cannot be refuted and incorrect accusations cause a player to be removed from play. Correct accusations lead to victory of the game.
